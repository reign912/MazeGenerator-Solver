maze-
Creates and solve mazes in Python.

_Algorithms
__Creating

- Prim's algorithm
- Kruskal's algorithm

__Solving
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search



Requirements
- NumPy
- Pillow
- [pyprocessing](https://github.com/jsmolka/pyprocessing) if you want to run the visual examples


setting up the program---
just open command prompt in setup.py directory and insert the following command and enter:
$ pip install .
in unbuntu the command will be:
$ pip3 install .


for visuals or realtime generation and solving:
pyproccesing should be imported which is already imported , and go to pyprocessing directory and cmd prompt
run the following cmd
$ pip install .

thats it setting up is done and just go to src/ and can run our main function main.py and 
can change algos used and maze size respectively in main.py

to run visuals or in simple words how our maze is created and solved in animated form , go to visuals/create or solve/ and run any algorithms you want in cmd : $ python algorithmname.py and you will be able to see the visual

THANK YOU
