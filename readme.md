setting up the program---
just open command prompt in setup.py directory and insert the following command and enter:
$ pip install .
in unbuntu the command will be:
$ pip3 install .


for visuals or realtime generation and solving:
pyproccesing should be imported which is already imported , and go to pyprocessing directory and cmd prompt
run the following cmd
$ pip install .

thats it setting up is done and just go to src/ and can run our main function main.py and 
can change algos used and maze size respectively in main.py
